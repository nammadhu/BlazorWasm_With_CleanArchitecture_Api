Always API expects appkey otherwise wont repond... then authentication/authorization all
ClientWasm calls Anonymous with interceptor AppKey(MyTown) to get config
Api Anonymous checks for key then returns default configuration for town

On MainLayout razor if logged in
	getIdTokenAsync()
		exract Googletoken & send over header on HttpAnoynmousINterceptor(key) ValidateG endpoint to get ApiJwt then sets in memory
		//todo currently only google handled, if more added then had to add more for the same
	API side 
		validating key first
		then Authorize Using Google-Token scheme JWT validation
		then issuing JWT of user to clientResponse
		
All Anonymous endpoints checks for AppKey at bare minimum
*Currently Encryption not implemented will do later

All Auth endpoints, checks for Key at first then verifies the JWT and process action
If Create/update/delete then at appcontext stes createdby/modifiedBy then saves


Some old chats:

Already working feature:
clientside:Blazor webassembly standalone(.net 8)
google authentication & pasing same token to api request
Currently using HttpBearerTokenInterceptor adding token & passing google token alone but not storing any other token 
APi: Asp.net core(.net 8) having Anonymous & Authorize endpoints
For Authorize endpoints, had to validate token received from client. 

Need to implement:
if respective account exists in db (if not then creae account)  then return id, & necessary  jwt to clients.
Later on all every requests should validate the same & also whenver required fetch userid to store in db records
Help me with full code how to implement this(Need to implement: section) ecurely & robust.


i have api, with both anonymous and authorize endpoints. whenever i receive requests with Authorize header & token, i should check the user already exists or not. if exists fetch the userid in db & return jwt to user. if not create in db.
 
  

I Need validation of my architecture stability & security in production, currently i implemnted Asp.Net core API & Blazor Webasssembly Standalone. Regarding clientside secrity & hosting models I need assistence

Hi,
We are building apps(web) & technology targeting to Tier 2 & 3 cities business & development. Before this also built many Non-Profit apps, but nowhere getting proper customers or money earning way atleast for my investment. Now further Projects also feels little feared. So I need expertise guidance on my way & corrections 



client					
1.google login
2.fetch User/Get (making sure by calling in mainlayout authService.GetIdTokenAsync())
	if exists then store in localstorage else nothing
3.On AuthCall, interceptor adds Gtoken and header of KTuserId,KTroles,KTjwt in request
4.Api side validate, if authorized then exract	KTuserId,KTroles,KTjwt & make sure GTowken also same 
on userid required place use KTuserid 


what i was assuming is, 
 send google issued token to api with anonymous endpoint called "configuration/userinfo",let api check the information & get the respective userinformation & in return it send api issued token, then client stores that in memory & send for all further endpoints requests as authorization header.
 is this wrong or what,please clarify me?
step2> 

Auth flow of my blazor webassembly & web api
1.After Google authentication, Blazor app receives the ID token (Google-issued).
2.Blazor app then sends the ID token to the API.
3.The API validates the ID token and extracts relevant claims (e.g., user ID).
4.If authorized, the API issues a JWT token (API-issued) containing additional claims.
5. Blazor app stores the JWT token and sends it in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests.


step1. after login sending token to post validatetoken endpoint to get new  api token
step2. store it in memory & include in all further requests
step3.

1.login make sure of handling offline stored value  & overwrite
2.after login extract role & respective action only on each place,try same like neozhu
3.Role manage,currently add 5 roles
4.On Click of Add/Edit then had to redirect by itself if not logged in
Rather after filling then error or redirection is problem



  my current setup is i have application for town in which many anonymous viewable options & endpoints, few authorize endpoint actions. for which my client is blazor standalone webassembly with remote authentication (google) ,at beginning it starts with extracting the app configuration from api endpoint called Config/Get(Currently anonymous), based on that authentication all will  be loaded. client side  once user authenticated sending that google token to api side using User/validate(currently anonymous) endpoint, once validated either creating or fetching the details it returns api issued jwt token. then that token will be used for Authorize endpoint handling.
  
 i will be getting token only after submitting google token till then it needs to be anonymous, so instead of making it anonymous, can i send google token also in header & api side let it validate as authentication for only User/Validate endpint policy, remaining all endpoints api issued toke validation rule/policy. so help em with that code & safe logic. if possible for anonymous endpoints make a some key in between client & server like currentTodayDate+clientname so api side if thats then only serving anonymous endpoints, to avoid other calling publicly
